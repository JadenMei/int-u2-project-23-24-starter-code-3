  <img src="gun control.webp" alt="people protesting">
  <p>Gun Control leads to less gun death per year. Guns are the leading cause for homicide and, child death, and suicides. Removing the guns from people would lead to less homicides and suicide. Less then 1% of the people with a firearm used it to protect themselves each year and most people use them to commit and felons.This will allow people with the good intentions to protect themselves instead of allowing people to use them with the intention of harming others.</p>
